# calendar-organize

An interactive JavaScript calendar that allows users to view, add, edit, and delete events for any date. The calendar dynamically generates the days of each month and highlights the current day, as well as dates matching a search query. Events are persisted using local storage, ensuring data is saved between sessions.

## Features

- **Dynamic Date Generation**: Displays the correct days for each month and year, with the first day aligned according to the weekday.
- **Event Management**: Add, edit, and delete events directly on the calendar by clicking on specific dates.
- **Date Highlighting**: Highlights the current date and dates matching the user's search query.
- **Navigation**: Easily navigate between months and years using dropdowns or navigation buttons.
- **Local Storage**: Events are saved in the browser's local storage, allowing data persistence across page reloads.
